# xCape's TF2 config

### **WARNING**
*This config is* ***VERY*** *personalized, competitive-oriented config, there are probably a lot of settings and changes you need to adjust to or change yourself inside the config file!*

*I suggest using this config along with my hud, cHUD!*

I'm going to try adding as many explanations to each command as I can, in order to give users to ability to form their configs much easier!
You can edit and see the xcape-config.cfg however you want to.

Also, if you wish to help me, you can suggest edits anytime, if you run into issues, let me know.
You can also help me write blurbs. Any help is warmly welcomed!

## Changes

- Adds crosshairs that change their style depending on whether you are using primary, secondary or melee weapons!

- Spy
  - Binds
    - R - Use last disguise (uses a sound cue)
    - V - Undisguise (uses a sound cue)
- Medic
  - For medic, I'm using a competitive script to easily switch between load-outs or to respawn with my uber intact.
  
	This is optional, if you don't touch the F1-F3 keys, you'll be fine playing as medic.

	Set your load-outs like this:  

		A: Medigun default
		B: Kritz default
		C: Medigun with DIFFERENT hat\misc\non-strange compared to A
		D: Kritz with DIFFERENT hat\misc\non-strange compared to B
  - The mediguns and their beam are invisible
  - Binds
  	- R - Fake uber (also sends *>> FAKED CHARGE <<* message in team chat)
  	- E - Call for medic (also shows nearby teammates medic bubbles through the wall)
  	- F1 - Respawn with the same medigun
  	- F2 - Swap between kritz and uber (if configured correctly as shown below) 
  	- F3 - Respawn with the same loadout (backup used when the connection to the loadout servers is lost)
  	- Mouse2 - Use ubercharge (also drops the flag and sends *>> CHARGE USED <<* message in team chat)
